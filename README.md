# Grazioso-Salvare-Rescue-Dog-Dashboard-Project
Project Overview

This repository contains the final dashboard project for Grazioso Salvare, a company that specializes in training dogs for rescue missions. The dashboard enables users to filter and explore data related to dog breeds suitable for different types of rescue scenarios. It was built using Dash, MongoDB, and Python, and incorporates interactive charts, maps, and a data table.

Written Reflection

1. Writing Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable Code
To ensure maintainability, I used modular design principles, such as separating CRUD operations into a dedicated Python module (crud_module.py). This allowed me to reuse code and focus on the dashboard logic in Project Two without duplicating effort. The code is commented clearly and structured to allow future enhancements, such as adding new filters or modifying database queries. The advantage of using a reusable CRUD module was that it simplified the database interaction and ensured consistency across different parts of the application. In the future, this CRUD module could be adapted for use in other dashboards or data-driven applications.

2. My Problem-Solving Approach as a Computer Scientist
My approach began with understanding the client requirements from Grazioso Salvare. I broke down the problem into manageable components: database structure, user interface layout, interactivity, and data visualization. Compared to previous courses, this project demanded a more integrated full-stack solution. I used debugging, iterative testing, and modular design to ensure each part functioned correctly before integration. For future client requests, I would follow a similar strategy but place more emphasis on early prototyping and user feedback.

3. What Computer Scientists Do and Why It Matters
Computer scientists solve real-world problems through logical, efficient, and scalable systems. In this project, my work helps Grazioso Salvare identify dogs suitable for specific rescue missions, which ultimately improves their operations and saves lives. Building a custom dashboard like this empowers non-technical users to access and interpret critical data easily. This kind of project showcases how technology can directly support mission-driven organizations by enhancing their decision-making and workflow efficiency.
